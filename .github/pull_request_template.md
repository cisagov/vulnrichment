# Please note!

While we appreciate your efforts to make Vulnrichment better, please note the
[README](https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment?tab=readme-ov-file#issues-and-pull-requests)
guidance on PRs: If your PR is proposing changes to a CVE ADP record directly, it is unlikely to
be merged in the usual way due to the way we build CISA-ADP container on the back end. We will
definitely use your code as a guide, but you may not see an actual merge. We'll note this in
this PR when your proposal makes it to production (or doesn't).

In a related vein, if your PR is an attempt to update a CVE record *outside* of the CISA-ADP
container, it will almost certainly be rejected. No offense intended, but if you have an
issue with a CVE record, the best place to deal with errors or omissions in a CVE record is
at [MITRE](https://cveform.mitre.org) directly.

If your PR is anything other than an edit to a CVE record (such as documentation or examples),
we're able to handle it as a typical pull request.

Finally, please make sure to describe what you intend to accomplish with your PR. That way
we can assess it and make any suggestions to further your goals.

Thanks for your interest in Vulnrichment!
