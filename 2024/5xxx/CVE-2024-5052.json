To ensure the security and uninterrupted operation of the Cerberus FTP server, the manufacturer recommends the following mitigation measures: Update to the latest supported version: Customers are recommended to always update to the latest supported version of the Cerberus FTP server. This ensures access to the latest security enhancements and features, along with protection against known vulnerabilities. Secure access to SOAP port 10001: Customers can protect access to SOAP port 10001 using Cerberus configuration settings. It is recommended to configure access restrictions and authentication settings to limit access to authorized users. In addition, the use of external firewall rules to restrict access to SOAP port 10001 is advised. It is recommended that clients whitelist only trusted IPs with access to this port. Enable remote SOAP access if necessary: It is recommended that customers enable the \"Allow Remote SOAP Access\" feature only when necessary for legitimate SOAP clients. This practice minimizes the attack surface and reduces the risk of unauthorized access."
